## Ratafia's Mod to Find Things
The minimalist mod to help novices find creatures, structures or tools. Click *find* button, choose an option, and you will automatically go towards it. The touchstone will be reactivated if you use the mod to find it.

## Modify Upper Limit
Configure characters' upper limits of health, hunger, and sanity. CHANGE ALL will change the value for all characters and ignore other configurations. Keep CHANGE ALL at Off to configure specific characters. Three upper limits are changed together. WX78 is not supported currently.

## Petify
Make the nearest creature your pet by one simple click. This is still under development. Abusing this may cause bugs. Please report bugs if you find any.
